Each Timepix pixel can be independently operated in one of three possible modes: (1) counting of the detected particles; (2) measurement of the particle energy; and (3) measurement of the time of interaction. The energy measurement in the second mode is performed via the determination of the “time-over-threshold” (TOT). The energy measurement with the Timepix detector in \{TOT\} mode requires knowledge of the energy calibration of each pixel of the matrix. Such calibration is very nonlinear in the low energy range and can be described by a surrogate function depending on four parameters. The determination of all these parameters can be performed by measurement and evaluation of the response of each pixel in at least four calibration points. The procedure is extremely demanding: it requires the analysis of at least 250 thousand spectra and the performance of 330 thousand least-squares fits. In this article, it is demonstrated that even better result can be achieved with only two or three calibration points halving the number of least-squares fits needed. The method is based on precise analysis of the shape of spectral peaks. The article also discusses the performance of energy calibrated device for spectrometry of heavy charged particles. "

Furthermore, validation of earlier Monte Carlo predictions about the radiation field in \{ATLAS\} is necessary. In particular, it is important to perform these measurements in the early phases of the \{LHC\} operation. Many other radiation measuring devices lack sensitivity to low doses, and usually do not provide information on the composition of the radiation during this low intensity period. A network of 15 ATLAS-MPX devices has been installed at various positions in the \{ATLAS\} detector. These devices are capable of providing quantitative real-time information on the fluxes and flux distributions of the main radiation types in the experiment, including slow and fast neutrons. The technical description of the ATLAS-MPX detector network as well as the principles of the data analysis is presented. "

The Data Visualization application, also with a web interface, has been developed in order to present measured data to the scientific community. It allows to browse through recorded frames from all devices and to search for specific frames by date and time. Charts containing the number of different types of tracks in each frame as a function of time may be rendered from the database. "

  abstract={The semiconductor pixel detectors Medipix2, Timepix and Medipix3 (256x256 square pixels, 55x55 μ m each) are superior imaging devices in terms of spatial resolution, linearity and dynamic range. This makes them suitable for various applications such as radiography, neutronography, micro-tomography and X-ray dynamic defectoscopy. In order to control and manage such complex measurements a multi-platform software package for acquisition and data processing with a Java graphical user interface has been developed. The functionality of the original version of Pixelman package has been upgraded and extended to include the new medipix devices. The software package can be run on Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems. The architecture is very flexible and the functionality can be extended by plugins in C++, Java or combinations of both. The software package may be used as a distributed acquisition system using computers with different operating systems over a local network or the Internet.}

  abstract={The ATLAS-MPX detectors are based on Medipix2 silicon devices designed by CERN for the detection of different types of radiation. These detectors are covered with converting layers of 6 LiF and polyethylene (PE) to increase their sensitivity to thermal and fast neutrons, respectively. These devices allow the measurement of the composition and spectroscopic characteristics of the radiation field in ATLAS, particularly of neutrons. These detectors can operate in low or high preset energy threshold mode. The signature of particles interacting in a ATLAS-MPX detector at low threshold are clusters of adjacent pixels with different size and form depending on their type, energy and incidence angle. The classification of particles into different categories can be done using the geometrical parameters of these clusters. The Medipix analysis framework (MAFalda) — based on the ROOT application — allows the recognition of particle tracks left in ATLAS-MPX devices located at various positions in the ATLAS detector and cavern. The pattern recognition obtained from the application of MAFalda was configured to distinguish the response of neutrons from other radiation. The neutron response at low threshold is characterized by clusters of adjoining pixels (heavy tracks and heavy blobs) left by protons and heavy ions resulting from neutron interactions in the converting layers of the ATLAS-MPX devices. The neutron detection efficiency of ATLAS-MPX devices has been determined by the exposure of two detectors of reference to radionuclide sources of neutrons ( 252 Cf and 241 AmBe). With these results, an estimate of the neutrons fields produced at the devices locations during ATLAS operation was done.}
